Hello there and welcome <br> <br>

This little project serves to illustrate differences between various sorting algorithms.. and to improve my skills in python :) <br> <br>

* Implemented algorithms: bubbles, insertion, merge, quick, cocktail  <br>
* Algorithms to implement: timsort (default python for sorted function), selection, double selection, radix, in place/out of place algorithms, gnome sort, heap sor, gravity (bead), counting <br>
* Implemented structures: array (duh) <br>
* Structures to implement: list, stack, queue, tree, heap, hashing <br>
