Hello there and welcome <br> <br>

This little project serves to illustrate differences between various sorting algorithms.. and to improve my skills in python :) <br> <br>

* Implemented algorithms: bubbles, insertion, merge, quick, cocktail, counting, gnome, selection  <br>
* Algorithms to implement: timsort (default python for sorted function), double selection, radix, in place/out of place algorithms, heap sor, gravity (bead) <br>
* Implemented structures: array (duh) <br>
* Structures to implement: list, stack, queue, tree, heap, hashing <br>

More things to do: <br>
* Add stopwatch on the screen
* Add possibility to run multiple windows with different sorting algorithms, probably from same seed :)
